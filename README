This is the original CSSR-v0.1.1 apart from 

1) the corrected header file (Common.h)

2) two extensions by Chrystopher Nehaniv 
(output to .g file for analysis with GAP, see 
Main.cpp, Main.h, Machine.cpp, Machine.h).

3) several corrections by Reinoud Maex, 
up to 24 January 2020 (up to Report 40).
These corrections comprise:

a) a minor change in Main.cpp to allow 
CSSR to run in batch with the -s option
(in the default version the significance value
was asked for interactively).

b) a correction in AllStates around line 252
to prevent the program from exiting with error msg
'a too large'.

c) several bugs corrected as described in 
Reports 36-39.
Most of these changes made by RM can be localized
by the command
> grep -n RM *.cpp
